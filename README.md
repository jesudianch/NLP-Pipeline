# NLP-Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project involves web scraping from an online bookstore website using **Scrapy**. The collected data will be processed through an NLP pipeline for further analysis.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Python 3.9+
- Scrapy

## Installation and Setup
### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following commands to set up a virtual environment:
```sh
conda create -n scrapy python=3.9
conda activate scrapy
pip install scrapy
```

### Step 2: Create a Scrapy Project
Set up the Scrapy project structure:
```sh
mkdir scrapy
cd scrapy
scrapy startproject bookscraper
cd bookscraper
```

### Step 3: Run the Scrapy Spider
Execute the Scrapy crawler:
```sh
scrapy crawl bookscraper
```

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts book details from an online bookstore.
- **Data Processing**: The extracted data will be cleaned and processed for NLP analysis.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to scrape more data sources.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI-based text analysis for book summaries.
- Use **NLP models** to categorize books based on content.
- Integrate with a database for structured storage.
